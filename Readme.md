[wiked!](https://github.com/tpierrain/wiked) is a nice web site template to be used with maven in order to transform markdown files into html ones. wiked! aims to keep together, what varies together (source code, documentation, etc).

**wiked!Pad is the most productive tool you can find in order to contribute to your own wiked! sites.**


Indeed:

+ wiked!Pad helps you to edit the best possible markdown files for your project
	+ its real-time HTML preview will allow you to check the way your markdown files will be transformed afterwards (wiked!Pad is using the same markdown parser as maven)

+ wiked!Pad fully wraps the usage of the Version Control System (VCS) where your wiked! site template  is hosted
	+ thus, you can now let non-developer contributing to your wiked! site

+ wiked!Pad hides the maven site file structure conventions
	+ helping you to focus on the end (i.e. the resulted web site), and not the means (which convention to be followed to produce such as web site with maven)

wiked!Pad does not aims to generate your static HTML web site. It helps you to work on its content.
